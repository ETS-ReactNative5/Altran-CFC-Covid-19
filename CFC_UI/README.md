Patient app will be used by user and share the symptoms with Health Assistant framework for quick analysis with the support of watson service. To customize the application, after getting the code of patient app, Here is the procedure to build Android APK file to install on the phone.

#### Steps to create an android signed APK starts 

Step 1: Generating an upload key

- You can generate a private signing key using keytool. 

On Windows 
- keytool must be run from C:\Program Files\Java\jdkx.x.x_x\bin.
- Run: (Admin)
$ keytool -genkeypair -v -keystore my-upload-key.keystore -alias my-key-alias -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
This command prompts you for passwords for the keystore and key and for the Distinguished Name fields for your key. It then generates the keystore as a file called my-upload-key.keystore.
Note â€“ 
The keystore contains a single key, valid for 10000 days. The alias is a name that you will use later when signing your app, 
so remember to take note of the alias.

On Mac, 
- if you're not sure where your JDK bin folder is, then perform the following command to find it:
$ /usr/libexec/java_home
- It will output the directory of the JDK, which will look something like this:
/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdkX.X.X_XXX.jdk/Contents/Home
- Navigate to that directory by using the command $ cd /your/jdk/path and use the keytool command with sudo permission as shown below.
$ sudo keytool -genkey -v -keystore my-upload-key.keystore -alias my-key-alias -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000

Note: Save this keystore file on some loaction of your system

Step 2: Go to healthAssistance directory folder and run

$ yarn build: android

? Choose the build type you would like: (Use arrow keys)
> apk - Build a package to deploy to the store or install directly on Android devices
  app-bundle - Build an optimized bundle for the store
  
-- Select apk

And complete one time build process (These question will not be asked again)

An Expo user account is required to proceed.
? How would you like to authenticate? (Use arrow keys)
> Make a new Expo account
  Log in with an existing Expo account
  Cancel
  
-- Select 'Make a new Expo account' if account does not existing

3. Run 'yarn status:android'

4. Use adb command to install on Android Phone

This will give you the path to apk file. Just run that path on browser, it will start downloading your apk.


#### Symptoms Capture in the Patient App
The patient app has been integrated with watson service, the watson service has been used to capture the user symptoms and stored the shared symptoms and generated results in the relevant cloudant database. The backend service generates the score for recently captured symptoms for each user and update the suspected analysis report about the covid-19 in DB.


- Create and Deployed on watson service through IBM account. 
-. Upload the entities, enable system entities and dialogs skills (The entities, dialog skills and other related information available at [PATH](https://github.com/hackaltran/Altran-CFC-Covid-19/tree/master/watson-symptom-capture).)

- Customize theame on the watson and service and deploy the relevant watson service on IBM cloud.

###### Note - The patient app has already integrated the watson service to capture the symptoms of the user.
