| Details                    | URL |
| ------                     | ------ |
| <strong>Introduction</strong> - Designing a seamless experience for the patient and medical practitioners using persona, user journey.                | [Intro.pdf](https://github.com/hackaltran/Altran-CFC-Covid-19/blob/master/UX_Design/Intro.pdf) |
| <strong>User Persona</strong> - We created a user person to identify the users. There are four types of users.                | [Users.pdf](https://github.com/hackaltran/Altran-CFC-Covid-19/blob/master/UX_Design/Users.pdf) |
| <strong>Hills</strong> - Hills are statements of intent written as meaningful user outcomes. They tell you where to go, not how to get there, empowering teams to explore breakthrough ideas without losing sight of the goal.                      | [Hills.pdf](https://github.com/hackaltran/Altran-CFC-Covid-19/blob/master/UX_Design/Hills.pdf) |
| <strong>User Flow</strong> - We created user flows to identify the journey of the user.                   | [UserFlows.pdf](https://github.com/hackaltran/Altran-CFC-Covid-19/blob/master/UX_Design/UserFlows.pdf) |
| <strong>Visual Design</strong> - This is a visual design flow of all four users. We are showing all user's journey here.             | [VisualScreenFlows.pdf](https://github.com/hackaltran/Altran-CFC-Covid-19/blob/master/UX_Design/VisualScreenFlows.pdf) |
| <strong>Prototype</strong> - This is a clickable prototype for Mobile App/ Website which gives an idea of how a user will interact with the App/website.                  | [Mobile App Screen](https://xd.adobe.com/view/badd3b96-443f-442c-4b17-1f791ae99b8e-ccec/)
|                            |[Medical Assistant Screen](https://xd.adobe.com/view/ea338b94-c972-494b-75f7-29a5e62a8cb2-9c02/ )

## Getting started

To get started with Health Assistant solution, you can choose any of the following two approaches - 

#### Approach 1 : Build and compile the solution
Take git clone at a location of your choice on your system.

```
   git clone https://github.com/hackaltran/Altran-CFC-Covid-19.git
```
After clone verify the following folders :

- CFC_API : Patient Backend Service
- CFC_UI : Patient App
- CFC_Monitoring : Monitoring Backend Service
- CFC_MonitoringUI : Moniroting Dashboard

Use the README.md files to build and compile solutions as mentioned below -

| Solution                   | README |
| ------                     | ------ |
| Patient Backend Service    | [README.md](https://github.com/hackaltran/Altran-CFC-Covid-19/blob/master/CFC_API/README.md) |
| Patient App                | [README.md](https://github.com/hackaltran/Altran-CFC-Covid-19/blob/master/CFC_UI/README.md) |
| Monitoring Backend Service | [README.md](https://github.com/hackaltran/Altran-CFC-Covid-19/blob/master/CFC_Monitoring/README.md) |
| Moniroting Dashboard       | [README.md](https://github.com/hackaltran/Altran-CFC-Covid-19/blob/master/CFC_MonitoringUI/README.md) |

#### Approach 2 : Use the existing deployed infrastructure 

Use the following URL's to access the existing infrastructure -

| Infrastructure             | Deployment |
| ------                     | ------ |
| Patient Backend Service    | [Patient Restful APIs](http://184.172.241.147:30222/api/user/953441888) |
| Patient App                | [Mobile App - Patient](https://github.com/hackaltran/Altran-CFC-Covid-19/tree/master/CFC_UI/apk) |
| Monitoring Backend Service | [Monitoring Restful APIs](https://c4c-monitorapi.df.r.appspot.com/doctors) |
| Moniroting Dashboard       | [Monitoring Dashboard](https://c4c-monitor.df.r.appspot.com/login) |

#### Default Credentials
To use solution and existing deployed infrastructure, you can register yourself as a new patient or you can use the default credentials saved in our cloudant database placed at respective paths-

###### Patient (to be used for accessing Patient Mobile App) - [PATH](https://github.com/hackaltran/Altran-CFC-Covid-19/blob/master/CFC_UI/apk/patient_app_credentials.txt)

###### Doctor (to be used for accessing Monitoring Dashboard) - [PATH](https://github.com/hackaltran/Altran-CFC-Covid-19/blob/master/CFC_MonitoringUI/public/monitor_dasboard_credentials.txt)

###### Medical Assistant (to be used for accessing Monitoring Dashboard) - [PATH](https://github.com/hackaltran/Altran-CFC-Covid-19/blob/master/CFC_MonitoringUI/public/monitor_dasboard_credentials.txt)
